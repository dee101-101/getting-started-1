## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This exercise was a great way for me to review CSS grid and flexbox as well as making code responsive.


### Useful resources

- [Centering in CSS Guide](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/) - Helped me vertical align my container. Had everything algned horizontally, but after multiple attempts at aligning vertically using different methods, this article helped me. I was supposed to set the parent container to a grid and the child container margin to auto to align in the center verically. It worked perfectly.
